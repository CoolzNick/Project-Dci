          The Acropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a rocky
          outcrop above the city of Athens, Greece, and contains the remains of
          several ancient buildings of great architectural and historical
          significance, the most famous being the Parthenon.
          <span>
            The word Acropolis is from the Greek words ἄκρον (akron, "highest
            point, extremity") and πόλις (polis, "city").[1] The term acropolis
            is generic and there are many other acropoleis in Greece.</span
          >
          During ancient times the Acropolis of Athens was also more properly
          known as Cecropia, after the legendary serpent-man Cecrops, the
          supposed first Athenian king.

          Knossos is a Bronze Age archaeological site in Crete. The site was a
          major center of the Minoan civilization and is known for its
          association with the Greek myth of Theseus and the minotaur.
          <span

            tourist destination. Knossos is dominated by the monumental Palace
            of Minos. Like other Minoan palaces, this building served as a
            combination religious and administrative center rather than a royal
            residence.</span
          >
          The earliest parts of the palace were built around 1900 BC in an area
          that had been used for ritual feasting since the Neolithic. The palace
          was continually renovated and expanded over the next five centuries
          until its final destruction around 1350 BC.

          <span>Myths and Symbols in Modern </span> Greek Art
        </h3>
        <p class="logo">
          The National Gallery - Alexandros Soutsos Museum, Nafplio Branch,
          presents the exhibition "Myths and Symbols in Modern Greek Art
          (19th-early 20th century)" from Saturday 10 June 2023 to Sunday 30
          June 2024.
          <span>
            This temporary exhibition features a collection of sculptures,
            paintings, and drawings that showcase the creative interpretations
            of Greek artists who have embraced, evolved, and transformed
            mythological themes into new forms of artistic expression. The
            exhibition opening will take place on Saturday 10 June at
            20:30.</span
          >
          Initially, the reception of myth by Greek painters and sculptors
          adhered to the conventions of academic art. However, in the late 19th
          century, European Symbolism infused new energy into mythological
          subjects, setting the stage for the avant-garde artists of the 20th
          century.In addition to the artworks on display, the exhibition aims to
          decode the symbols present in mythological art and explore the values
          and messages they convey to contemporary audiences. Educational
          programs will be implemented to facilitate this exploration.
